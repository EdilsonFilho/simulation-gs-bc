# Ground Station Simulation

This simulation showcases the positions of 11 ground stations from the AWS Ground Station, simulated using Matlab Satellite Communication. This project was developed as part of the research work for the IEEE paper titled "Advancements in Satellite Communications."

## Introduction
The simulation presents the spatial positions and interactions of 11 ground stations specifically from the AWS Ground Station. It leverages Matlab Satellite Communication tools to model and visualize the dynamics and communication scenarios between these stations.

## Setup
To run this simulation, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility. Please set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies before running the simulation.

### Venv
```sh
souce venv/bin/activate
```
